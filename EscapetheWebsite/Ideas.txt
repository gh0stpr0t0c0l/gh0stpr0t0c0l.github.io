CHANGE IMAGE ALT TEXT

alexander graye on about page with no picture

instead of "our work", "other projects by escapethewebsite.com" - real escape rooms?

"this employee into mazes, charts, etcc. etc." - order of files in file system OR "favorites are 1. mazes, 2. charts etc. etc"

"Contact our staff for web dev help"
"if the website is giving you trouble, the admin code is ###"
